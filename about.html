                    My name is Reuben Clemens and I am a Sophomore in the 
                    FYE(First Year Exploratory) program. My previous year 
                    was spent exploring the CS field and learning the concepts 
                    for coding. While I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it, 
                    I found that my stimulation lied somewhere else. After making 
                    contact with my Advisor, I found the UX UI major and how it 
                    incorporated the coding aspect I enjoyed. I am now learning 
                    design and creating user-friendly websites.

                <h2>2022 - Start of College</h2>
                <p>
                    When I started at Drexel University I found myself in the First Year Exploratory Major.
                    As I had previously gone to a trade school for IT, I began taking CS courses. While I
                    really enjoyed the programming aspect, I realized the formatting of the lectures and how
                    the plan of study was set that it wasn't for me. I then decided near the end of my first
                    year at Drexel explore a new Major.

                <p>
                    After being recommended the UXID Major, I began exploring it in my sophomore year of College.
                    It was a breath of fresh air as the classes I took introduced me to new topics and ideas that
                    I previously hadn't thought of.

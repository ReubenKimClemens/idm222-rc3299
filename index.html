                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, My name is Reuben Clemens and I am currently a student 
                    at Drexel University studying UX UI design.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                <p>
                    The Portfolio I have contains previous projects I have made 
                    as well as templates I have created. These templates follow 
                    general designs to show what type of styles I am able to 
                    replicate for your website. I also provided pictures in 
                    Photography that may give insight in my ability of framing
                    and also my capability in taking shots for the website itself.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-2">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    The About Me provides more information on previous experiences
                    and other skills I am able to deliver. It also contains links
                    to my github and other such sites.
                </p>

                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>
                    If you wish to contact me, the Contact page contains my 
                    email, phone number, and zoom. 
                </p>
            </div>

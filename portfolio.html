            <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe JS Project</h2>
            <p>
                The video playing above is a previous javascript project
                I worked on during highschool. It works by keeping a list
                of each players move and comparing it to an array of objects
                that contain information on winning patterns.

                The image above shows the website I redesigned for my idm211
                class.The original website had many problems with readability
                and contained too much excess space. I removed some and made
                the design simplier.
